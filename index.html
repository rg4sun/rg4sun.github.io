    <p>Last updated: <strong>24 June 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Blood Hero App is part of a research project jointly conducted by the University
      of Southampton (UoS), United Kingdom, and the University of Health and Allied
      Sciences (UHAS), Ghana. The project is designed to strengthen the resilience of
      Ghana’s health system and enhance public safety through equitable blood-donation
      services, in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
      notably SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).
      It seeks to foster international partnership and generate evidence for digital
      health interventions, thereby contributing to universal health coverage and reducing
      inequalities. The project focuses on strengthening emergency healthcare through a
      cross-platform digital blood-donation system in rural Ghana, aiming to improve
      real-time donor coordination and hospital response efficiency.

    <h2>2. Prototype Phase and Simulated Use</h2>
    <p>
      This app is currently in the prototype phase and will undergo simulated use and user
      evaluation at UoS and UHAS. All testing phases involve simulations only; no actual
      blood donation takes place. These simulations assess donor-recruitment communication
      methods and the overall blood-request and donation-management workflow.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Registration Data:</strong> Participants provide demographic details such
        as name, email address, phone number, gender, address, height, weight, education
        level and past donation experiences. All identities are either fabricated by
        participants or supplied as mock data by the research team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage Data:</strong> During app use, data generated include timestamps,
        geographical and location data, and request–response details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model and operating system are also
        collected.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >At this stage, all data generated are expected to be mock data produced during
        simulated use and will not include any real user information. Any data arising
        from unsupervised use of the app with real personal details is entirely outside
        our oversight, and we assume no responsibility for it. All data at this stage will
        be cleared periodically and not retained long-term.</strong

        hospitals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Push Notifications:</strong> To deliver timely updates on blood requests
        and status changes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All data are transmitted over HTTPS and encrypted using the AES standard. Stored
      data are protected with strict access controls on secure servers.

    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. When significant changes occur, we will
      notify you by posting the revised policy on this page and, where appropriate,
